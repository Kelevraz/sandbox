<!-- Step 21Passed
Variables can be assigned a value. When you do this while you declare it, this is called initialization. For example:

var camperbot = "Bot";
This would initialize the camperbot variable with a value of Bot, a string.

Initialize your xp variable to have a value of 0, a number. -->

var xp = 0;

<!-- Step 22Passed
Initialize another variable called health with a value of 100, and a variable called gold with a value of 50. -->

var xp = 0;
var health = 100;
var gold = 50;

<!-- Step 23Passed
Create another variable called currentWeapon and set it to 0.

When a variable name has multiple words, the convention in JavaScript is to use what's called camelCase. The first word is lowercase, and the first letter of every following word is uppercase. -->

var xp = 0;
var health = 100;
var gold = 50;
var currentWeapon = 0;

<!-- Step 24Passed
You have been declaring your variables with the var keyword. However, in modern JavaScript it is best practice to use the let keyword instead. This fixes several unusual behaviors with var that can make your code difficult to debug.

Change all of your var keywords to let. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;

<!-- Step 25Passed
Using the let keyword, declare a variable called fighting but do not initialize it with a value. Remember to end your line with a semi-colon. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;

<!-- Step 26Passed
Declare two more variables named monsterHealth and inventory, but do not initialize them. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;
let inventory;

<!-- Step 27Passed
The variables you have assigned have all had values that are numbers. JavaScript has multiple different data types. The next one you will use is the string. Strings are used to store things like words or text. Strings are surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks. Here is an example of declaring a variable with a string:

let developer = "Naomi";
Assign the inventory variable to have the value of stick. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;
let inventory = "stick";

<!-- Step 28Passed
The player's inventory in your game will be able to hold multiple items. You will need to use a data type that can do this. An array can be used to hold multiple values. For example:

let order = ["first", "second", "third"];
This is an array which holds three values. Notice how the values are separated by commas.

Change your inventory variable to be an array with the strings stick, dagger, and sword. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;
let inventory = ["stick", "dagger", "sword"];

<!-- Step 29Passed
For now, you want the player to start with just the stick. Change the inventory array to have stick as its only value. -->

let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;
let currentWeapon = 0;
let fighting;
let monsterHealth;
let inventory = ["stick"];

<!-- Step 30Passed
JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.

One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in your HTML, you would write:

let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
Note that h1 is a string and matches the CSS selector you would use.

Create a button1 variable and use querySelector() to assign it your element with the id of button1. Remember that CSS id selectors are prefixed with a #. -->

let button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");

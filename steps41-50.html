<!-- Step 41
Now create a goCave function that prints Going to cave. to the console. -->

function goCave() {
  console.log("Going to cave.");
}

<!-- Step 42
Now create a fightDragon function that prints Fighting dragon. to the console.

Once you have done that, open your console and try clicking the buttons on your project. -->

function fightDragon() {
  console.log("Fighting dragon.");
}

<!-- Step 43
The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element. For example:

const info = document.querySelector("#info");
info.innerText = "Hello World";
This code would change the element assigned to the info variable to have the text Hello World.

When a player clicks your Go to store button, you want to change the buttons and text. Remove the code inside the goStore function and add a line that updates the text of button1 to say Buy 10 health (10 gold). -->

function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
}

<!-- Step 44
Now, add a line that updates the text of button2 to say Buy weapon (30 gold) and update the text of button3 to say Go to town square. -->

function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
}

<!-- Step 45
You will also need to update the functions that run when the buttons are clicked again.

In your goStore() function, update the onclick property for each button to run buyHealth, buyWeapon, and goTown, respectively. -->

function goStore() {
button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
button1.onclick = buyHealth;
button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
button3.onclick = goTown;
}

<!-- Step 46
Now you need to modify your display text. Change the innerText property of the text to be You enter the store. -->

function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

<!-- Step 47
Create three new empty functions called buyHealth, buyWeapon, and goTown. -->

function buyHealth() {
}
function buyWeapon() {
}
function goTown() {
}

<!-- Step 48
Move your goTown function above your goStore function. Then copy and paste the contents of the goStore function into the goTown function. -->

function goTown() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

function goStore() {
  button1.innerText = "Buy 10 health (10 gold)";
  button2.innerText = "Buy weapon (30 gold)";
  button3.innerText = "Go to town square";
  button1.onclick = buyHealth;
  button2.onclick = buyWeapon;
  button3.onclick = goTown;
  text.innerText = "You enter the store.";
}

function goCave() {
  console.log("Going to cave.");
}

function fightDragon() {
  console.log("Fighting dragon.");
}

function buyHealth() {

}

function buyWeapon() {

}

<!-- Step 49
In your goTown function, change your button elements' innerText properties to be Go to store, Go to cave, and Fight dragon. Update your onclick properties to be goStore, goCave, and fightDragon, respectively.

Finally, update innerText property of your text to be You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store. -->

function goTown() {
  button1.innerText = "Go to store";
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says Store.";
}

<!-- Step 50
You need to wrap the text Store in double quotes. Because your string is already wrapped in double quotes, you'll need to escape the quotes around Store. You can escape them with a backslash \. Here is an example:

const escapedString = "Naomi likes to play \"Zelda\" sometimes.";
Wrap the text Store in double quotes within your text.innerText line. -->

function goTown() {
  button1.innerText = "Go to store";
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}

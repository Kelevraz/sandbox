<!-- Step 61
Instead of assigning the innerText and onclick properties to specific strings and functions, the update function will use data from the location that is passed into it. First, that data needs to be passed.

Inside the goTown function, call the update function. Here is an example of calling a function named myFunction:

myFunction(); -->

function goTown() {
  update();
}

<!-- Step 62
You now need to pass the location argument into the update call. You pass arguments by including them within the parentheses of the function call. For example, calling myFunction with an arg argument would look like:

myFunction(arg)
Pass your locations array into the update call. -->

function goTown() {
  update(locations);
}

<!-- Step 63
The locations array contains two locations: the town square and the store. Currently you are passing that entire array into the update function.

Pass in only the first element of the locations array by adding [0] at the end of the variable. For example: myFunction(arg[0]);.

This is called bracket notation. Values in an array are accessed by index. Indices are numerical values and start at 0 - this is called zero-based indexing. arg[0] would be the first element in the arg array. -->

function goTown() {
  update(locations[0]);
}

<!-- Step 64
Now your update function needs to use the argument you pass into it.

Inside the update function, change the value of the button1.innerText assignment to be location["button text"]. That way, you use bracket notation to get the button text property of the location object passed into the function. -->

function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"];
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}

<!-- Step 65
location["button text"] is an array with three elements. Change the button1.innerText assignment to be the first element of that array instead. -->

function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = "Go to cave";
  button3.innerText = "Fight dragon";
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}

<!-- Step 66
Now update button2.innerText and button3.innerText to be assigned the second and third values of the button text array, respectively. -->

function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = goStore;
  button2.onclick = goCave;
  button3.onclick = fightDragon;
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store\".";
}

<!-- Step 67
Following the same pattern as you did for the button text, update the three buttons' onclick assignments to be the first, second, and third values of the button functions array. -->

function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerText = "You are in the town square. You see a sign that says \"Store.\"";
}

<!-- Step 68
Finally, update the text.innerText assignment to equal the text from the location object. However, instead of using bracket notation, use dot notation.

Here is an example of accessing the name property of an object called person:

person.name -->

function update(location) {
  button1.innerText = location["button text"][0];
  button2.innerText = location["button text"][1];
  button3.innerText = location["button text"][2];
  button1.onclick = location["button functions"][0];
  button2.onclick = location["button functions"][1];
  button3.onclick = location["button functions"][2];
  text.innerText = location.text;
}

<!-- Step 69
Now update your goStore function to call the update function. Pass the second element of the locations array as your argument.

To make sure your refactoring is correct, try clicking your first button again. You should see the same changes to your webpage that you saw earlier. -->

function goStore() {
  update(locations[1]);
}

<!-- Step 70
Create two more empty functions named fightSlime and fightBeast. These functions will be used in your upcoming cave object. -->

function fightSlime() {

}

function fightBeast() {

}

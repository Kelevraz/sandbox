<!-- Step 71
Add a third object to the locations array. Give it the same properties as the other two objects.

Set name to cave. Set button text to an array with the strings Fight slime, Fight fanged beast, and Go to town square. Set the button functions to an array with the variables fightSlime, fightBeast, and goTown. Set the text property to You enter the cave. You see some monsters.. -->

{
    name: "cave",
    "button text": ["Fight slime", "Fight fanged beast", "Go to town square"],
    "button functions": [fightSlime, fightBeast, goTown],
    text: "You enter the cave. You see some monsters."
  },


<!-- Step 72
Now that you have a cave location object, update your goCave function to call update and pass that new cave location. Remember that this is the third element in your locations array.

Don't forget to remove your console.log call! -->

function goCave() {
  update(locations[2]);
}


<!-- Step 73
Now that your store and cave locations are complete, you can code the actions the player takes at those locations. Inside the buyHealth function, set gold equal to gold minus 10.

For example, here is how you would set num equal to 5 less than num: num = num - 5;. -->

function buyHealth() {
  gold = gold - 10;
}


<!-- Step 74
After the gold is updated, add a line to set health equal to health plus 10. -->

function buyHealth() {
  gold = gold - 10;
  health = health + 10;
}

<!-- Step 75
There is a shorthand way to add or subtract from a variable called compound assignment. For example, changing num = num + 5 to compound assignment would look like num += 5.

Update both lines inside your buyHealth function to use compound assignment. -->

function buyHealth() {
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
}


<!-- Step 76
Now that you are updating the gold and health variables, you need to display those new values on the game screen.

After your assignment lines, assign the innerText property of goldText to be the variable gold. Use the same pattern to update healthText with the health variable.

Here is an example:

let value = 100;
const total = document.querySelector('#total');
total.innerText = value;
You can test this by clicking your "Go to store" button, followed by your "Buy Health" button.

Note: Your answer should only be two lines of code. -->

function buyHealth() {
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
healthText.innerText = health;
}

<!-- Step 77
What if the player doesn't have enough gold to buy health? When you want to run code conditionally, you can use the if statement. Put all of the code in your buyHealth function inside an if statement. For example:

function myFunction() {
  if ("condition") {
    console.log("Hello World!");
  }
}
For now, the if statement condition should be set to the string condition as a placeholder. -->

function buyHealth() {
  if ("condition") {
  gold -= 10;
  health += 10;
  goldText.innerText = gold;
  healthText.innerText = health;
  }
}

<!-- Step 78
The condition string is just a placeholder. Change the if statement condition to check if gold is greater than or equal to 10.

Here is an if statement that checks if num is greater than or equal to 5:

if (num >= 5) {
} -->

function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10) {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    healthText.innerText = health;
  }
}

<!-- Step 79
Now when a player tries to buy health, it will only work if they have enough money. If they do not, nothing will happen. Add an else statement where you can put code to run if a player does not have enough money.

Here is an example of an empty else statement:

if (num >= 5) {

} else {

} -->

function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10) {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    healthText.innerText = health;
  }
  else {
}
}

<!-- Step 80
Inside the else statement, set text.innerText to equal You do not have enough gold to buy health.. -->

function buyHealth() {
  if (gold >= 10) {
    gold -= 10;
    health += 10;
    goldText.innerText = gold;
    healthText.innerText = health;
  } else {
    text.innerText = ("You do not have enough gold to buy health.");
  }
}
